# WeatherTracker
A weather app that uses the OpenWeatherMap API.

# Background
I wrote the first version of this app back in 2010 because of my natural interest on weather phenomena and love for coding.

After taking a look at the old code I decided that it was time for a rewrite by using the OpenWeatherMap API.

The UI is going to be redesigned and hopefully look much better than before.


Part of the code for the OpenWeatherMapAPI was taken from https://github.com/swiftyspiffy/OpenWeatherMap-API-CSharp/
